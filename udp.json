Last but not least, Meow-sketeer has fairly good survivability for a midrange Rusher, with a high KB count and high backswing keeping him out of danger as much as you could really hope for.

His other main weakness is that his HP is not too impressive, which stops him from taking full advantage of his high KB count, especially in late/endgame where he can die in just a few hits. His high speed worsens this issue by causing him to run ahead of your frontline often, taking hits that a slower unit would avoid. Late game Zombies also pose a problem as he cannot Z-Kill them, and their burrow/revive mechanics can infiltrate his blindspot and deal some heavy damage. D'artanyan in First Form, meanwhile, as a Sniper loses to other midrange LD and Wave units such as Housewife, Fiend or talented Pizza in piercing and standing range, and despite his high DPS you can often make use of even more spammable units such as Cameraman and Manic Flying to more quickly build up close range DPS.", "While D'artanyan's First Form faces tough competition from non-Uber Midrangers with better survivability, higher spammability and longer piercing range, his Evolved Form truly shines as an extremely destructive and versatile midrange Rusher with anti-Wave and sniping capabilities.

Status-inflicting Angels like Sleipnir and Winged Pigge similarly give her a hard time.

In his few use cases, Rare and Super Rare Alien CC options are always preferable. Yaminoir obtains a more respectable range but suffers from very low base stats and speed for a midrange tank, even in his target traits, failing to work as a tank and not really having meaningful DPS even then. As a Barrier Breaker he offers little that Kitty of Liberty does not. His mediocre weaken uptime makes his CC unimpressive at best, again failing to justify using over Rare/Super Rare control units for Aliens, and does not work at all against Shielded Akus. This, combined with his range, means his only relevant targets in that trait are Aku Gory and Condemned Peng, with no answer to the harder to handle Akus. Even then, the Level Seal effect in Aku Realms means your units are often too low levelled to even meaningfully endure weakened hits from these enemies.", "In conclusion, Yamii's low quality ability and stats in both forms render him next to useless in all specialist and generalist domains.

Ranged Angel and Zombie enemies who are poorly covered by non-uber options such as Cadaver Bear, Chickful A, Winged Pigge and Sleipnir can be nuked for over 100k damage in a single hit.

Diabolosa's 475 range lets it outrange anti-Bahamut enemies like The SLOTH/Master A and, in combination with its slow speed, helps keep it safe in general backline use. Low speed is also conducive to defending the base from burrowing Zombies, and low summon cost for a backline Uber is helpful on cash tight stages, of which there are many in the Aku and Zombie metas.", "Diabolosa's foreswing is painfully long, similar to Crazed Bahamut, leading to it often whiffing its attacks and reducing its already poor base DPS, considerably below general backliner standard. This also leaves it vulnerable to hard-pushing Akus or Angels, and burrowing Zombie ambushes. Diabolosa also lacks Shield Pierce, relying on raw DPS or the support of a dedicated Shield Piercer to make meaningful progress against them. Akus with Death Surges and Burrowing/Reviving Zombies also bypass its range advantage and can quickly eliminate it from the field, at which point its huge 3 minute cooldown is punishing and potentially fatal. Diabolosa is also incredibly slow to move, and while this offers some defensive advantages it makes it overall worse at fulfilling the need for backline DPS.", "All-in-all, Siege Walker Diabolosa is a unit with substandard base stats and a plethora of weaknesses which almost entirely eliminate its general usefulness and meaningfully hinder its performance against its target traits.

Similarly, his long attack cycle and absence of Shield Pierce on second hit make his average time to remove a shield 18 seconds, which is on the higher end for ubers with this role. Thus, on hard-pushing Aku stages, you still need some reasonable luck to land the pierce before you lose too much ground, and once again his poor stats offer no backup should the pierce fail; it's very much All Or Nothing, and when a spell of bad RNG strikes, it's 2.5 minutes of cooldown and ~5000 cash lost.

When close to the enemy base, Cat God will stop 850 range away from it, allowing him to provide occasional knockback support and damage from a safe range, and potentially wear down the enemy base given enough time. This ability to chip down the enemy base before killing the boss gives him viability in a few stages such as Floor 32, Mineral Treatment and Li\u2019l Eraser. When far from the enemy base, this instead gives Cat God a massive 500 piercing range, allowing him to hit practically every enemy on the field.

While the Lugas can at least use their high range to make up for their poor defense, Cat God's unusually short 350 standing range puts him in harm's way, giving him even worse survivability than them. His glacially slow attack speed compounds this issue, as you'll need to protect Cat God for a long time to get more than one use out of him; when not near the enemy base, it's rare for him to survive long enough to attack twice. His very slow Cooldown also harms his performance in both of his roles; he takes a long time to stack up and start doing appreciable damage to the enemy base from a distance, and when he dies, he won't be available to use again as a panic button for a long time. Cat God's use also declines late in the game, as the stages he's useful on become rarer due to the increased prevalence of LD, wave, and surge enemies.", "Overall, Cat God the Great offers some potentially powerful burst damage and long-range knockback support, but is held back greatly by his terrible survivability, awful attack speed, and very long Cooldown.

All of these applications are incredibly important in the very late game such as 2/3/4 Crown UL, and his role is highly unique and hard to replace.", "Doron's most obvious weakness is that he dies after attacking, making his attack a one-time-use bomb. This forces you to use him carefully, especially when you have to wait nearly a minute to try again. If you send him at the wrong moment when the enemy frontline is shifted by a large amount, even his piercing Omnistrike cannot always save you from a disappointing miss. Furthermore, his Surge has a very wide random spawn area; at minimum it may only reach up to 525 range and not damage certain backliners, while at maximum range it may only hit from 750 upwards and go entirely past more midrange targets. As most of his damage is in his Surge, this can be fatal if your strategy depends on it. It is less of a problem for his CC use as the unextended base 8s Freeze on the initial hit is still amazing. Doron's huge HP is also not infallible. Stacks of high magnification enemies can and will cut through even that much HP in a few seconds if given the chance, and his lack of Toxic Immunity is a potential weakness too.", "Elder Mask Doron is a completely unique unit with incredibly potent anti-Relic CC and burst damage applications. His synergy with Idi to Freeze and rush down Relics is almost a requirement when fighting the insanely magnified enemies of 2/3 Crown UL, and under 4 Crown UL restrictions. He has failsafes against missing his attacks with his high HP, immunities and piercing range, but it can still happen under bad circumstances. This and/or his Surge RNG can potentially render him useless in the worst case scenario, but with skilled and careful use Doron can nevertheless be an irreplaceable strategic tool in every endgame player's arsenal."], "Rarity": "Story Legends"}}
