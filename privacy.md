# Terms and Conditions for CatBot

**Effective Date:** [2024-07-12T00:00:00+0000]

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to CatBot (the "Bot"). This privacy policy ("Policy") explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your information when you use our Bot in the Discord application.

## 2. Information We Collect

- **Discord Username and User ID:** We do not collect any information on you besides in the cases explained below.
- **Deleted Messages and Media:** We collect any media and any text you send in the r/bc server only if you delete it or it was in the muted people chat. We perform this operation to prevent users from deleting messages which can result in rule infractions in the server or to otherwise log what happens in said chat. 
- **Messages Containing "bad words":** In the context of Battle Cats, there are words and terminologies which represent cheating or hacking, which they are not allowed by the rules of the server. Catbot will read each message sent and will log the presence of such terms. A message which doesn't hold such terms or a message which CatBot doesn't "think" means cheating (Not AI powered, just a list of words combination) are not stored. 

## 3. How We Use Your Information

- **Moderation Information:** We use the data collected in the above mentioned to examine the history of users when they commit rule infractions in the server. 

## 4. How We Share Your Information

### 4.1 Third-Party Services
- **Cross Server Operations:** The moderatorsof the server, at their discretion, might provide an excerpt of the data or a resumÃ© should a cross server operation requires it (E.G. a member is suspected to have joined a server while being banned with another account which still belongs to them)
- **Other Third parties:** We never sell your data, under any circumstance. We share the data in the circumstances required above, when required. 

### 4.2 Legal Requirements
- The way CatBot is coded, it can only read your messages if you join the r/bc server. Being in the server, as explained in its welcome section, is an implicit acceptance of its terms.

## 5. Data Security

CatBot sends all data it collects back to Discord; it stores nothing in any other place. The data is as secure as Discord allows.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected and to comply with legal obligations. Being bound to Discord, it also depends on Discord not deleting the data on their servers.

## 7. Your Data Protection Rights

Regardless of your location, you have the following rights:
- **Access:** The right to request copies of your personal data which was logged during the above mentioned cases.
- **Erasure:** The right to request deletion of your personal data under certain conditions. We might keep an explanation of the missing data which holds the information which will be missing. (E.G. If we somehow get access to a selfie of yours and you want it delete it, we'll delete it, then we'll log by text only that a selfie of you was deleted)
- **Restriction of Processing:** Only moderators or r/bc are able to process your information. Given their duty to process your data in terms of moderation, you cannot object to restriction.
- **Objection to Processing:** You cannot object to us processing the data in the way it was explained before. If you still wish to object, leave the r/bc server.

## 8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date.
