they are found in imagedatalocal, within files that end with 02.maanim
the numbers are one below the numbers for unit csv
while unit001.csv is basic cat, in imagedatalocal, basic cat is represented by 000
prefix _f is for first form, _c is for second form, and _s is for true form
rest is irrelevant in this case
To determine the backswing, first we need to figure out how to read maanim
First, ignore the first two lines. Irrelevant
The third line specifies the amount of animation sets
we'll use bahamut cat first form as an example
the fourth line is an animation set. Animation sets have five numbers per line
below an animation set is the amount of keyframes, represented by a single number
each keyframe consists of four numbers per line
next, you will want to record every first number that appears in each keyframe line
rinse and repeat until all of the first numbers are recorded
after that, find the highest number
then add it by 1
in bahamut's case, it's 150
add it by 1 to make it 151
and this is how long bahamut's attack animation is
subtract it by his foreswing, which is 121
and you get 30
30 is bahamut cat's backswing
